Yes,Olfactory Navigation Framework,"A project all about olfactory navigation. Allows the implementation of agents, building olfactory environments, run rimulations, and analyze results","In this project, I built a Python framework for the problem of Olfactory Navigation.<br>This framework is meant to allow a user to define the properties of an agent, and test its performance using simulations within an environment. To define an agent, the user needs to implement a limited set of functions (initialize_state, choose_action, update_state, kill). Then, the environment can be built from a numpy (.npy) or HDF5 (.h5) file. The source needs to be placed within the environment and the margins need to be defined. The environment supports having multiple olfactory layers, and multi-dimensional data. The environment provides some useful functions for the agent to interact with it such as: random_start_position, get_observation, at_source. Finally, the simulation function combines these elements together by hiding the exact position of the agent from it and moving it within the environment based on its chosen action. Once the simulation is done, the results can be saved very conveniently within readable csv files that can further be analyzed with pre-defined plotting functions.",https://github.com/PimLb/olfactory-navigation,Olfactory_Navigation_Illustration.png,Python,,,
