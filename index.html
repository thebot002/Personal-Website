                            My research focusses on model-based reinforcement learning to the field of olfactory navigation in turbulent environments. I mainly work on using the concept of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. I work on finding solutions to simulate the behaviors of animals in order to undertand better how their sense of smell work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I finished a Master's Degree at the Università di Genova in March of 2024 after completing my thesis on olfactory navigation. Before that, I took part in the Data Science and Knowledge Engineering degree at Maastricht University. During that degree, I also took part in the Honour's program Ke@Work which allowed me to gain some experience working for a company, Open Line. I spent 2 years as an intern over there and completed my Bachelor's thesis there. Following this, I continued working as a consultant for the company for the following three years focussing on Business Intelligence as a Data Engineer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I really like programming, and am curious about many topics computer science related. During my Bachelor's degree I mainly used Java as a programming language. But following this, during my internship at Open Line, I got my hands on Python and database manipulation with SQL. I also learned to handle big amounts of data on daily using the ETL tools provided within the Microsoft Azure suite. Namely I worked using the Databricks platform where I got to work with the PySpark toolbox. Within my time at openline, I also learned a great deal about Source Control and development cycles. I got to help build a strong DevOps release pipeline that aimed at maximizing the data-availability for the company while allowing the Business Intelligence team of developping with as much peace of mind as possible.

                                    I helped maintain and further develop the <b>Business Intelligence (BI)</b> infrastructure of the company using <b>Microsoft Azure</b> services. The BI team was tasked with the <b>Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)</b> process of the data of the company. The ETL process was built using Databricks, DataFactory and the SSIS package of Microsoft Visual Studio.

                                    I also built <b>software frameworks</b> to speed up the processing of data to the various databases. This framework was also meant to simplify the daily operations of the BI team.

                                    As part of the Honours program of the Data Science and Knowledge Engineering Bachelor of Maastricht University I integrated the <b>Business Intelligence (BI)</b> team of Open Line. During my internship I undertook projects related to <b>Data Science</b> and <b>Optimization</b>.

                                    I developed an model for <b>Time-Series forecasting</b> applied to the forecasting of the amount of calls the various teams would receive in given periods.

                                    My largest project there, which was also my Bachelor's thesis, was an <b>Operation Research</b> problem. I got to develop an <b>Integer Linear Programming (ILP)</b> solution to suggest improvements within the virtualization of storage. These suggestions would be monitored regularly to apply the changes. The suggestions provided by the algorithm allowed for a considerable amount of money to be saved on a monthly basis.
                                </p>

                                    The solutions that I proposed also had to be efficient enough to be run on a daily basis as part of the morning <b>Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)</b> process. Along this, they were included within this process in order to benefit from fresh data every data and to provide the most up-to-date suggestions ad predictions.

                                    As the treasurer for the student association for two years (board 25 and 26), I succesfully managed the money flows of the organization while allowing very succesfull events to happen smoothly. Doing so while holding a balance of trying to keep the prices for the students during events as low as possible as the organization is not for profit, while also keeping enough to be able to plan ever more exciting events.

                                    During my Master's degree, I deepened my knowledge in the fields of data science and machine learning. I got to learn about topics such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speach Processing and Recognition, Multi-Agent Systems, or Computer Games. The various project I worked on for these various classes can be found on the <a href="/projects/">Project Page</a>.

                                    <b>Short Summary:</b> A solution to the Olfactory Navigation problem using a model-based Reinforcement Learning framework: Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). A multithreaded, GPU-capable implementation of the Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) solver was implemented leading us to confirm the apparition of casting and surging behaviors. Some potential shortcomings of the technique where also uncovered.<br>
