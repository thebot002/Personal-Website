                            My research focuses on model-based reinforcement learning applied to olfactory navigation in turbulent environments. I primarily work with Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to develop solutions that simulate animal behaviors, helping to improve our understanding of how their sense of smell functions.

                        <p>
                            I completed my Master's degree at the Università di Genova in March 2024, where I conducted my thesis on olfactory navigation. Before that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Knowledge Engineering from Maastricht University. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in the Honours Program Ke@Work, which gave me the opportunity to gain hands-on experience at Open Line. I spent two years there as an intern, completing my Bachelor's thesis at the company, and subsequently continued working as a consultant for three years. In this role, I specialized in Business Intelligence as a Data Engineer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have a strong passion for programming and a broad curiosity for various topics in computer science. During my Bachelor's degree, I primarily worked with Java, but during my internship at Open Line, I gained experience with Python and SQL for database manipulation. I also worked extensively with ETL tools in the Microsoft Azure suite, particularly Databricks and PySpark, handling large-scale data processing. At Open Line, I also deepened my understanding of source control and development cycles, contributing to the design of a robust DevOps release pipeline aimed at maximizing data availability while ensuring a smooth development process for the Business Intelligence team.

                                    I helped maintain and further develop the <b>Business Intelligence (BI)</b> infrastructure of the company using <b>Microsoft Azure</b> services. The BI team was responsible for the <b>Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)</b> process of the company's data. The ETL process was built using Databricks, DataFactory, and the SSIS package within Microsoft Visual Studio.

                                    As part of the Honours program in the Data Science and Knowledge Engineering Bachelor's at Maastricht University, I integrated into the <b>Business Intelligence (BI)</b> team at Open Line.

                                    My largest project, which also served as my Bachelor's thesis, focused on an <b>Operations Research</b> problem. I developed an <b>Integer Linear Programming (ILP)</b> solution to suggest improvements in the virtualization of storage. These suggestions were regularly monitored to apply necessary changes. The algorithm's recommendations resulted in significant cost savings on a monthly basis.
                                </p>

                                    Additionally, the solutions I proposed needed to be efficient enough to run daily as part of the morning <b>Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)</b> process. This integration allowed the solutions to leverage fresh data each day, providing the most up-to-date suggestions and predictions.

                                    As a student ambassador for Maastricht University, I <b>promoted</b> my study program (Data Science and Knowledge Engineering) and the university to prospective students. As part of this role, I assisted during Open Days by <b>sharing my experience</b> as a student and <b>tutoring a programming exercise</b> for high school students. I also guided prospective students participating in the "<b>Student for a Day</b>" activity, helping them experience a typical day at the university and giving them a glimpse of what they could potentially be part of in the coming years.

                                    I am currently working on my PhD in Computer Science at the Università di Genova. My research focuses on model-based reinforcement learning applied to olfactory navigation in turbulent environments. I primarily work with Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to develop solutions that simulate animal behaviors, helping to improve our understanding of how their sense of smell functions.

A multithreaded, GPU-accelerated implementation of the Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) solver was developed, which led to the observation of casting and surging behaviors. Additionally, some potential shortcomings of the technique were identified.<br>
